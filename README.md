<h1>Weather APP</h1>

The weather application allows users to retrieve current weather information for a specified location. It utilizes Vanilla 
JavaScript for the front-end to create a lightweight and efficient user interface, and integrates with a weather API to fetch weather data.

<h3>Key Features:</h3>

<b>(1) Location-based Weather:</b> Users can input a location (city, country, etc.) and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location.<br>
<b>(2) Display Weather Information:</b> The application displays various weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather 
    conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), and possibly a weather icon representing the current conditions.<br>
<b>(3) Error Handling:</b> The application handles errors gracefully, displaying informative messages if the location is not found or if there is an issue with fetching weather data.<br>
<b>(4) Responsive Design:</b> The application is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.<br>
<b>(5) User-Friendly Interface:</b> The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and input fields for users to enter their desired location.<br>

<h3>Architecture:</h3>

<h4>(1) Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript):</h4>

<b>* DOM Manipulation:</b> JavaScript is used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the user interface with weather information.<br>
<b>* Event Handling:</b> Event listeners are utilized to capture user input (location) and trigger actions such as fetching weather data.<br>
<b>* AJAX Requests:</b> XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the weather API and retrieve weather data.<br>
<b>* Error Handling:</b> JavaScript code includes error handling mechanisms to handle situations such as invalid user input or failed API requests.<br>
<b>* Responsive Design:</b> CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques are used to ensure the application's responsiveness across different devices.<br>
